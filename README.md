## Dataset: 
This dataset included two files (an xlsx and a csv file) which contained an unstructured information on lady bugs such as:<br>
     -sex<br>
     -Information on how and when they were were collected<br>
     -Scientific Names<br>
using Rstudio, we organized and cleaned the data to perform analysis and give descriptions using different visuals.
## Cleaning
 Step 1: Renaming different columns and rows so that it would have a formal and lineared data set<br>
 Step 2: Left joining the two files<br>
 Step 3: Got rid of Day from date so that we could analyze by month and observe trends<br>
